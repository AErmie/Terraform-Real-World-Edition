# Terraform Real-World Edition

This repo contains more realistic real-world environment examples that leverage Terraform. 

For example, there is a separate module codebase for deploying ...

* An Azure DevOps (ADO) project, complete with pipelines
* A hub-and-spoke (ie. shared services) network topology
* Gorvernance and compliance environment guardrails
* A set of Azure services that imitate a real-world application
